Statement of Work:
I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work

Description:
This assignment is an example of a HTTP server and client which implement OpenSSL and mTLS.
I solved this problem by mainly following the "Hands-On Network Programming with C" textbook by
Lewis Van Winkle. This text was invaluable for me understanding how to wrap a socket in SSL, however
I needed to look to other resources for how to set the minimum TLS version, load the certificate files,
and verify the certificate files for mutual TLS since the textbook did not cover this topic. The result
was a simple yet elegant server/client combo which connect to each other, make a successful TLS handshake,
exchange a request and response, then close.

How To:
Inside a terminal in the root directory of this project, four different make commands can be used. These include the following:
1. `make all` : builds both server and client binaries
2. `make server` : builds server binary
3. `make client` : builds client binary
4. `make clean` : removes all compiled binaries from project directory

Additionally, it is important to note that the server configures its ip address based on the machine it is compiled on. So,
if you would like to send the server to separate machine other than the client (simply using a loopback address to test on one computer)
than you must run `make server` on the server host itself.

Lessons Learned:
This project went much more smoothly than project 1 because I actually felt like I had a grasp on the fundamentals of network
programming. However, the biggest lesson I learned was related to the whole process of OpenSSL and the back and forth between
the server and client. Because I didn't do enough research to understand this process in depth, I thought I had completed the
project without having actually implemented mTLS. Initially I was frustrated with this realization, but after finding a few valuable
repositories on Github and a guide online I discovered that the mTLS implementation wasn't so bad. To summarize, I should do some more
in depth research next time around to understand the underlying mechanisms more properly.

Test Case:
I simply created a constant string on both the server end and the client. The client begins by connecting to the server
and sending its request (the string) which says "Request for greeting!" Then, the server sends a response saying "Hello world!"
which confirms that the communication works. Then the client closes the connection and the server continues listening for a followup.
